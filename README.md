##Runtime Assessment

  When the pivot is the midpoint and the array is already sorted: n

  When the pivot is random and the array is random: nlogn

  When the pivot is the first element and the array is sorted: n^2

##Methodology

  The class QuickSortTester runs quicksort against arrays of 1000, 5000, 10000, 50000, and 100000 elements. Trials are timed; the program runs the sort 100 times on each array size before averaging the times for each array. This data is collected and recorded before being graphed. The graph is then compared to the standard Big O graphs to figure out its efficiency.
